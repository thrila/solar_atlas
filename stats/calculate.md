# how to calculate number of panels needed for <A> kWh

### panel assumptions 
- panel is 80% effecient
- panel standard output = 400W

therefore the effective panel output = panel standard output * panel effeciency

### Daily output of a panel
Daily energy = panel output * amount of time power > 120w

### Number of panels needed to get x

number of panels needed = number of Kwh wanted / energy per panel

# calculate electricity that will be generated for N panels
number of Kwh = number of panel * energy per panel


# Calculating emisson factor
Our emission factor _Carbon intensity of electricity_ is in gCO2/kWh to get in in kgC02/kWh:
$emission_factor_kg = emission_factor_g / 1000$

### C02 saved 
CO₂ saved (tons) = Annual solar energy produced (kWh) × emission factor (kg CO₂/kWh) ÷ 1000


## CO₂ Savings: Tree Equivalent

To express your **solar CO₂ savings** as the number of **trees planted**, use the global average absorption rate of a mature tree.

###  Assumption

> **1 mature tree absorbs ≈ 22 kg CO₂/year**  
> → **0.022 tons CO₂/year**  
> (Source: *EPA, UNEP, WWF estimates*)

- Applies to common species like **neem, mango, oak, pine**  
- Mature = **10+ years**, moderate soil/climate


### Formula

Trees Planted = CO₂ Saved (tons/year) ÷ 0.022
